## Walkthrough of Day 10 - SOC Alert Triaging - Tinsel Triage



## Theory - What will we learn?
* Understand the importance of alert triage and prioritisation
* Explore Microsoft Sentinel to review and analyse alerts
* Correlate logs to identify real activities and determine alert verdicts

### Alert Triaging
* In SOC, where there are many alerts at the same time,
* We need to orgenize and differ the Valueble Alerts from the false positives and just noise alerts.
* For that we have the Alert Triaging
We split the alets by few factors:
1. Severity [from informational to critical]
2. Time stemp And Frequencey --> check for related activity before and after The time of the attack.
3. Attack Stage - [From reconnaissance To  data exfiltration]
4. Affected Asset - Identify the system, user, or resource involved

To summerize:
* Severity: How bad?
* Time: When?
* Context: Where in the attack lifecycle?
* Impact: Who or what is affected?

After considering all the Factors we need to decide
* Escalate to Higher response teams
* Investigate depper
* Close the ticket if its false positive
